# SCT_DS_4
Traffic Accident Analysis
A comprehensive data analysis project that identifies patterns in traffic accidents based on road conditions, weather, and time of day. This repository provides tools for analyzing accident hotspots and visualizing contributing factors to help improve road safety.

🚗 Overview
This project analyzes traffic accident data to uncover insights about:

Accident frequency by time of day, day of week, and season
Weather conditions and their correlation with accident rates
Road surface conditions and visibility factors
Geographic hotspots and high-risk areas
Contributing factors and accident severity patterns


📊 Features
Data Processing: Clean and standardize accident data from multiple sources
Statistical Analysis: Identify significant patterns and correlations
Interactive Visualizations:
Heatmaps of accident hotspots
Time-series analysis of accident trends
Weather condition distributions
Road condition impact analysis
Reporting: Generate automated insights and safety recommendations

📈 Key Insights
The analysis typically reveals:

Peak accident times: Rush hours (7-9 AM, 5-7 PM) show highest accident rates
Weather impact: Rain and fog increase accident likelihood by 40-60%
Seasonal patterns: Winter months show increased severity
Road conditions: Wet/icy surfaces correlate with 3x higher accident rates
Geographic hotspots: Urban intersections and highway merges


🗺️ Visualizations
Heatmaps: Geographic distribution of accidents
Time Series: Hourly, daily, and seasonal trends
Correlation Matrix: Relationships between contributing factors
Interactive Maps: Clickable hotspots with detailed information
Statistical Plots: Distribution analysis and hypothesis testing


🔍 Future Enhancements
Machine learning models for accident prediction
Real-time data integration
Mobile app for risk alerts
Integration with traffic management systems
Advanced statistical modeling (Bayesian analysis)
